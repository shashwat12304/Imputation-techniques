      <p class = "lead">KNN imputer works on KNN algorithm.The fundamental of KNN algorithm is similarity. KNN stands for k nearest neighbors and it is generally used for classification.KNN algorithm stores all the cases and classifies all the cases on the similarity measure. K is the number of neighbors to include in the majority of the voting process. Choosing the right value of k is called parameter tuning and it is important as it can completely change our answer. There are several methods of choosing k such as<br>
•	Sqrt(n), where n is total number of data points.<br>
•	Odd value is selected<br>
KNN is a Lazy learner and it is only useful for small noise free datasets.Relations are calculated via Euclidean distance and the missing values are imputed with values from most similar rows.We use nan-Euclidean distances to define relationships in KNNimputer.
